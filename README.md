# Crop Monitoring Using data cubes

Welcome to our repository dedicated to advanced crop monitoring using image data. Our repository includes a range of features tailored for plant phenotyping 🌱.

## 🛠️ Key Features

This repository is made to dispose of several tools. Currently, there are available examples for:

* Orthomosaic Clipping 🗺️: Generate subset of orthomosaic images using spatial boundaries.
* Spectral Indices Calculation 📊: Calculate various spectral indices for assessing plant health. This tool supports indices like NDVI, NDRE, and more, offering a deep insight into crop vitality.
* 3D Visualization 🌐: Transform your data into interactive 3D models. Visualize crop height.
* Seeds detection 🌿: Deploy a pre-trained Mask-RCNN model for seeds high-througput phenotyping.
